# SmartSpy

SnartSpy is a simple reverse shell Trojan using socket programming. When the victim installs this malware on his mobile phone, the trojan will:

      •	 Connect to the attacker’s server that is listening for connections
      
      •	 Receive incoming commands sent by the attacker
      
      •	 Execute the commands sent by the attacker
      
      •	 Send the output of executed commands to the attacker


The example, presented in this project, is taken from the book : Hacking Android by Srinivasa Rao Kotipalli, Mohammed A. Imran.
